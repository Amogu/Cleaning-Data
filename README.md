========================================================
The scripts in this repo are used to clean and analyze the files in the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set' available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The run analysis.R script assumes that the required datasets "X_test.txt", y_test, X_train, y_train, features.txt, and activity_labels.txt are in the R working directory.
